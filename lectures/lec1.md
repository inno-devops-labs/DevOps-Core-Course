---

## 📍 Slide 5 – 📝 QUIZ — DEVOPS_L1_PRE

---

## 📍 Slide 6 – 🔥 Section 1: The Problem Before DevOps

* 👨‍💻 **Development** and ⚙️ **Operations** = separate teams, separate goals
* 🚀 Dev wants: **ship features fast**
* 🛡️ Ops wants: **keep systems stable**
* 💥 Result: **conflict, blame, slow delivery**

```mermaid

  Dev[👨‍💻 Dev Team] -->|🎯 New Features| Goal1[Ship Fast]
  Ops[⚙️ Ops Team] -->|🛡️ Stability| Goal2[Don't Break]
  Goal1 -.->|❌ Conflict| Goal2
```

---

## 📍 Slide 7 – 🧱 The Wall of Confusion

* 🧱 **The Wall** = invisible barrier between Dev and Ops
* 📦 Dev "throws code over the wall"
* 🔥 Ops catches the blame when it breaks
* 🔄 Ops rejects changes to avoid risk

```mermaid

  Wall -->|🔥 Catches blame| Ops[⚙️ Ops Team]
  Ops -->|❌ Rejects changes| Dev
```

> 🤔 **Think:** Have you seen this pattern before?

---

## 📍 Slide 8 – 😱 Manual Release Hell

* 📅 Deployments are rare (monthly, quarterly)
* 🎰 Each release = **high-risk event**
* 📋 Manual steps, checklists, weekend work
* 💀 One mistake = hours of rollback

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Code[✅ Code Complete] --> Wait[📅 Wait for Release Window]
  Wait --> Manual[📋 Manual Deploy Steps]
  Manual --> Pray[🙏 Pray It Works]
  Pray -->|💥 Failure| Blame[👉 Blame Game]
  Pray -->|😮‍💨 Success| Relief[Temporary Relief]
```

**📊 The Numbers:**
* 🐢 Average release cycle: **3-6 months**
* 📉 Success rate: **~60%**
* ⏱️ Rollback time: **4-8 hours**

---

## 📍 Slide 9 – 😨 Fear and Blame Culture

* 🌙 Incident happens at 2am
* 👉 First question: *"Who did this?"*
* 🙈 Engineers hide mistakes
* 🚫 Nobody wants to deploy on Friday
* 💀 Innovation stops

> ⚠️ **Fear kills velocity**

**😰 Signs of Blame Culture:**
* 🔇 People afraid to speak up
* 📝 Excessive documentation "for protection"
* 🐌 Slow decision-making
* 🚪 High turnover

**💬 Discussion:** Why does blame make things worse?

---

## 📍 Slide 10 – 💸 The Cost of Chaos

| 🔥 Problem | 💥 Impact |
|------------|-----------|
| 🐢 Slow releases | Lost market opportunity |
| 📋 Manual processes | Human error, burnout |
| 👉 Blame culture | Talent leaves |
| 🙈 No visibility | Firefighting mode |

**📈 Real Numbers:**
* 🏢 **Amazon pre-DevOps**: deploys took **weeks**
* 🚀 **Amazon post-DevOps**: deploys every **11.7 seconds**

**💰 Cost of Downtime:**
* 💵 Small business: **$427/minute**
* 🏢 Enterprise: **$9,000/minute**
* 🌐 Amazon: **$220,000/minute**

---

## 📍 Slide 11 – 💡 Section 2: What DevOps Really Is

* 🤝 **DevOps** = Development + Operations working as **one team**
* 🌱 A **culture** of collaboration and shared responsibility
* 🔧 A set of **practices** for fast, reliable delivery
* 🚫 NOT just tools, NOT a job title, NOT a team

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Dev[👨‍💻 Development] -->|🤝 Collaboration| DevOps[🚀 DevOps]
  Ops[⚙️ Operations] -->|🤝 Collaboration| DevOps
  DevOps --> Value[💎 Fast, Reliable Value]
```

**📖 Definition:**
> *DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently in close alignment with business objectives.*

---

## 📍 Slide 12 – 🚫 What DevOps is NOT

| ❌ Myth | ✅ Reality |
|---------|-----------|
| "We hired a DevOps engineer, we're done" | 👥 Everyone participates |
| "DevOps means using Kubernetes" | 🛠️ Tools support culture |
| "DevOps replaces developers/ops" | 🤝 It unites them |
| "DevOps = just automation" | 🧩 Automation + Culture + Measurement |
| "DevOps is a team" | 🌍 It's a way of working |

> 🔥 **Hot take:** You can't buy DevOps. You build it.

**🎯 DevOps is about:**
* 🧠 Mindset change
* 🤝 Breaking silos
* 🔄 Continuous improvement
* 📊 Data-driven decisions

> 🐶🐄 **"Pets vs Cattle"** — Which do you have?

**🐶 Pets:** Unique, irreplaceable, nursed back to health
**🐄 Cattle:** Identical, replaceable, automated

---

## 📍 Slide 20 – ✅ Solution: Infrastructure as Code

## 🛠️ Fix: IaC

* 📝 Define infrastructure in **version-controlled files**
* 🔄 Servers are **reproducible**, not unique
* ⚡ Spin up identical environments in **minutes**

```hcl
# 🌍 Terraform example
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  count         = 3  # 🔢 3 identical servers
}
```

**🎯 Result:** Cattle, not pets. Replace, don't repair.

**🛠️ IaC Tools:**
* 🌍 **Terraform** — Multi-cloud
* 🧩 **Ansible** — Configuration management
* 📦 **Pulumi** — Code-based IaC

* 🚫 **Never** store secrets in code
* 🔐 Use secret management tools (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
* 🔍 Pre-commit hooks scan for secrets
* 🔄 Rotate credentials automatically

```yaml
# ❌ Bad
password: "super_secret_123"

# ✅ Good
password: ${VAULT_DB_PASSWORD}
```

**🎯 Result:** Secrets stay secret

**🛠️ Secret Tools:**
* 🔐 **HashiCorp Vault**
* 🔑 **AWS Secrets Manager**
* 🔒 **Azure Key Vault**
* 🔍 **git-secrets** (pre-commit)

---

## 📍 Slide 23 – 🙈 Scenario 4: Blind Operations

**👥 Users report:** *"App is slow"*

**🤷 Team asks:**
* Is it? How slow?
* Which part is slow?
* Since when?
* How many users affected?

**😰 Answer:** No idea. No metrics. No logs. No visibility.

⏱️ **Hours spent guessing.**
